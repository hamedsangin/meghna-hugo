Hi guys

My name is Hamed Sangin and today start my new website to share my 4 years of experience in Building Performance Simulation (BPS).

In this BPSimulation website, we're going to create content to learn about all aspects of BPS including energy analysis simulation, CFD simulation, acoustic simulation, and ... for every type of buildings.

We hope this website be the thing you were finding for it :D.
